###to run:

In terminal, run `python formatImgs.py [output path]` where [output path] is the absolute path for the folder destination path. This function crops, resizes, and optimizes the image, outputting full size and thumbnail images 

protip: run `pwd | cb` in terminal at desination folder then paste as `[output path]` 

`python crop.py`, and `python resize.py` are cool too
